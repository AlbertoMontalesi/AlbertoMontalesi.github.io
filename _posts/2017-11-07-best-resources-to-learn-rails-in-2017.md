# Learning ruby on rails in 2017
For a more detailed explanation on why learning Rails is still a good choice even in 2017 you can read [this article](https://www.codementor.io/brookecampbell/is-ruby-on-rails-still-worth-it-in-2017-5wxguk5xn) but if you just want a short motivation then you just have to know that Rails is still in the top 10 of the most used programming languages and that is more than enough to make it a viable choice.

Studying alone can be very hard and if you want to achieve results you will have to put in a lot of effort and be sure that the resources you are using are the best you can find.
That is why I'm writing this list to help other self-taught developers save time on boring researches.

## [Jordan Hudgens - Dissecting Ruby on Rails 5](https://www.udemy.com/professional-rails-5-development-course/) 

I use Udemy a lot and it's rare to find a teacher as good as Jordan. 
Many teachers will just ask you to follow their steps but he actually goes the extra mile and explain a lot of what's happeping, how Rails works, why something is breaking and what are the best practices to follow.

His course focuses on building a portfolio website and a blog and utilizes Rails 5. 
It's quite long and I suggest you to watch it at incremented speed because Jordan speaks a bit too slow.

Apart from this minor flaw I think this is one of the best comprehensive courses on Rails that you can find.

You can get it [here](https://www.udemy.com/professional-rails-5-development-course/)

## [ Code4Startup - Build AirBnb with Rails 5](https://code4startup.com/?ref=albertomontalesi)

I belive in learning by doing projects and building AirBnb following Leo's videos will teach you many of the features you will probably implement on your future projects.

Despite not being a native speaker, there are no problems in following and understanding him.

Sometimes his explanation could be better, but as far as video courses that make you build a real product I believe that this one is the best.

I remember struggling a lot to find ways to implement certain features on my personal projects and I have to say that this course helped me a lot to understand how to do it and what I was doing wrong.

The course has been released in the summer of 2017 and it uses Rails 5.

You can buy this course and many others [here](https://code4startup.com/?ref=albertomontalesi)

## [Michael Hartl - Ruby on Rails 5 tutorial book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)

Earlier in 2017 I attended a 2 months rails bootcamp and I remember everybody in the class read this book (including me, of course).

Why? It's very simple
- it's free to read online
- it's easy to follow
- it provides you with all the foundation to build your own web applications

If you know nothing about Rails and you just want to test the ground then this book is what you need, you can read it for free [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) but you can also buy a copy on the [author website](https://www.railstutorial.org/)

## [Drifting Ruby - Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxJaNyXCQw0mghY0hA1wA9w) & [GoRails - Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIQmhQxCvLHRr3Beku77tww/featured)

If you just started learning Rails you may not know, or may have just heard about *railscast*, a popular series of videos containing tips and tricks for Rails, up to version 3.

Although not as popular as *railscast*, Drifting Ruby and GoRails provide tons of useful tips on how to implement features and how to improve your app.

I suggest you to check out both of these channels once you have a solid grasp of the basics, maybe after reading the aforementioned [Ruby on Rails 5 book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).



# Conclusion

With the abovementioned resources you should have enough material to cover from the basics to an intermediate level and be able to create even more advanced apps.

Whenever you encounter a problem remember that [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is your best friend and if you can, try to join a community around your area, or one online because working alone can be very tiring and stressing.

Seekin the help of other programmers will help you improve much faster than you think.

Happy Coding! and enjoy your time with Rails, I am sure you will love it as much as I do.
