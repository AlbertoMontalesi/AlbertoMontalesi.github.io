Quoting MDN:
> classes are primarily syntactical sugar over js's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax **does not** introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.


That being said, let's review prototypal inheritance before we jump into classes.

``` js
function Person(name,age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function(){
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}

const alberto = new Person("Alberto", 25);
const caroline = new Person("Caroline",25);

// alberto.greet();
// Hello, my name is Alberto
//caroline.greet();
// Hello, my name is Caroline
```

We added a new method to the prototype in order to make it accessible to all the new instances of Person that we created.

Ok, now that i refreshed your knowledge of prototypal inheritance, let's have a look at classes.

## Create a class

There are two way of creating a class:
- class declaration
- class expression


``` js
// class declaration
class Person {

}

// class expression

const person = class Person {

}
```

Let's start creating our first Class.

We only need a method called **constructor** (remember to add only one constructor, a *SyntaxError* will be thrown if the class contains more than one constructor methods).

``` js
class Person {
  constructor(name,age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  greet(){
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old` );
  } // no commas in between methods
  farewell(){
    console.log("goodbye friend");
  }
}

const alberto = new Person("Alberto",25);

// alberto.greet();
// Hello, my name is Alberto and I am 25 years old
// alberto.farewell();
// goodbye friend
```

As you can see everything works just like before. As we mentioned at the beginning, Classes are just a syntactical sugar,a nicer way of doing inheritance.

&nbsp;

### Static methods

Right now the two new methods that we created, *greet()* and *farewell()* can be accessed by every new instance of *Person*, but what if we want a method that can only be accessed by the class itself, similarily to *Array.of()* for arrays?

```js
static info(){
  console.log("I am a Person class, nice to meet you");
}

// alberto.info();
// TypeError: alberto.info is not a function

// Person.info();
// I am a Person class, nice to meet you
```
### Set and Get

We use setter and getter methods to set and get values inside our Class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name,surname) {
    this.name = name;
    this.surname = surname;
    this.nickname = "";
  }
  set nicknames(value){
    this.nickname = value;
  }
  get nicknames(){
    return `Your nickname is ${this.nickname}`;
  }
}

const alberto = new Person("Alberto","Montalesi");

// first we call the setter
// alberto.nicknames = "Albi";
// "Albi"

// then we call the getter
// alberto.nicknames;
// "Your nickname is Albi"
```

## Extending our Class

What if we want to have a new Class that inherits from our previous one? We use *extends*:


``` js
// our initial class
class Person {
  constructor(name,age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  greet(){
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old` );
  } // no commas in between methods
}


// our new class
class Adult extends Person {
  constructor(name,age,work){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.work = work;
  }
}

const alberto = new Adult("Alberto",25,"teacher");
```

We created a new Class Adult that inherits from Person but if you try to run this code you will get an error:

```js
ReferenceError: must call super constructor before using |this| in Adult class constructor
```
The error message tells us to call **super** before using **this** in our new Class.
What it means is that we basically have to create a new Person before we create a new Adult and the **super()** constructor will do exactly that.

``` js
class Adult extends Person {
  constructor(name,age,work){
    super(name,age);
    this.work = work;
  }
}
```

Why did we set **super(name,age)**? Because our Adult class inherits name and age from the Person therefore we don't need to redeclare them. 
Super will simply create a new Person for us.

If we now run the code again we will get this:

``` js
//  alberto.age
// 25
// alberto.work
// "teacher"
// alberto.greet();
// Hello, my name is Alberto and I am 25 years old
```

As you can see our Adult inherited all the properties and methods from the Person class.


## Extending Arrays

``` js
// we create a new Classroom
const class = new Classroom("1A", 
{name: "Tim", grade: 6},
{name: "Tom", grade: 3},
{name: "Jim", grade: 8},
{name: "Jon", grade: 10},
);
```

We created a new classroom where the first parameter is the name of it and the rest is a list of students.
