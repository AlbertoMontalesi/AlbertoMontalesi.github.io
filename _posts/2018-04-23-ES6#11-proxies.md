## What is a Proxy?

From MDN:

> the Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g. property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc).

&nbsp;

## How to use a Proxy?

This is how we create a Proxy:

``` js
var x = new Proxy(target,handler)
```

- our target can be anything, from an object, to a functin to another Proxy
- a handler is an object which will define the behavior of our Proxy when an operation is performed on it

``` js
// our object
const fruit = { type: "Apple", price: 10 };
// create a proxy
const fruitProxy = new Proxy(fruit, {
  get(target, price){
    return target[price].toUpperCase();
  }
});

fruitProxy.price = "10 usd/kg";
fruitProxy.price;
// 10 USD/KG"
```
